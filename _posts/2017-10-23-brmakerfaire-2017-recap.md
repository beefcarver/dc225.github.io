DC225 showed off a few projects and things (previous [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org/?utm_source=defcon225.org&utm_medium=Blog%20Post&utm_campaign=Shoutout) badges, a payphone turned VOIP, a roomba robot), shared knowledge, and networked with many people. The biggest hit was teaching all ages about lock picking.. and demonstrating how easy and insecure most locks really are.

There was mention of TOOOL ([The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers](https://toool.us?utm_source=defcon225.org&utm_medium=Blog%20Post&utm_campaign=Shoutout))'s [Rules of Ethics](https://toool.us/bylaws.html?utm_source=defcon225.org&utm_medium=Blog%20Post&utm_campaign=Shoutout) in the teachings, where ever possible.
  - Never pick or manipulate with the aim of opening any lock that does not belong to you, unless you have been granted explicit permission by the lock's rightful owner.
  - Never disseminate knowledge or tools of lockpicking to individuals whom you know or whom have reason to suspect would seek to employ such skills or equipment in a criminal manner.
