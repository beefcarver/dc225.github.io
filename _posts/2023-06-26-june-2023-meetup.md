**DEF CON 225 (DC225)**'s June 2023 meetup took place Saturday, June 24, 2023, at the Main Library on Goodwood Blvd. in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Attendees had a great time hanging out, learning about lock picking, discussing the latest cybersecurity news, events, and tools. They also had the opportunity to play with innovative devices like the Flipper Zero and Pwnagotchi. The meetup fostered a sense of community and provided valuable knowledge and hands-on experiences in cybersecurity. DC225 continues to be a platform for learning, connecting, and growing in the field.

DC225 also registered for and discussed project ideas for the [Baton Rouge Maker Faire](https://batonrouge.makerfaire.com/) coming up in October 2023.
