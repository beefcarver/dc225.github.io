On September 23, 2023, **DEF CON 225 (DC225)** held their September 2023 meetup at the Main Library on Goodwood Blvd. in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but this time with a twistâ€”it was streamed online for the first time. Attendees had a great time reminiscing Blac kHat and DEF CON shenanigans, learning about lock picking, discussing cybersecurity news, and using the latest tools. This virtual experience ensured members from anywhere could participate, marking a step towards inclusivity and growth for DC225's future meetups.
