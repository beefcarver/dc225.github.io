Over a dozen **DEF CON 225 (DC225)** members attended [NolaCon](https://nolacon.com/) 2024, bringing their unique flair with a custom "SAO" ("Shitty Add On") that attached to the official NolaCon badge and featured a CTF challenge. Amidst the conference's excitement, DC225 hosted a small meetup for their attending members.

One of the highlights of the event was the Saturday night party, featuring music guests int80 of [Dual Core](https://dualcoremusic.com/) and [Mikal KHill](https://mikalkhill.bandcamp.com/), who together form [The TroubleShooters](https://thetroubleshooters.bandcamp.com/album/production). We loved their music, which added an incredible vibe to the evening.

Overall, the group had a fantastic time, deepened their knowledge, and strengthened their community bonds.
