On February 3, 2024, **DC225** kicked off the year with their first meetup, following the absence of a January gathering. Due to a scheduling clash at the library, the meetup found its home at the "backup location". The event featured a presentation on recent cybersecurity news, engaging lock-picking activities, and hands-on exploration of tools like the Flipper Zero, various Flipper Zero GPIO boards, and custom Raspberry Pi projects.

Looking ahead, DC225 has exciting plans for 2024, including the continuation of virtual labs, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and training sessions every Wednesday evening on Discord. For those eager to dive into cybersecurity, the invitation to join their Discord community was extended. Stay tuned for more learning opportunities and community engagement throughout the year!
