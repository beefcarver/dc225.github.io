### Meetup Summary

**DC225** had a **meetup** on **February 10, 2016** from **7p-8pm** at [LSU Voodoo BBQ Bar & Grill](https://www.facebook.com/LSU-Voodoo-BBQ-Bar-Grill-115941018447781/) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

[Edward Atebara](https://EdAtLaw.com), a lawyer from Baton Rouge, was the guest speaker and offered great legal advice and information on certain topics involving DWI/DUI and proper proceedures to follow when interacting with law enforcement during the meetup.

There were a few challenges and puzzles meant to help grow, perfect, and demonstrate your skills.

Here was the crypto challenge if you would like to try it yourself. Good luck!
