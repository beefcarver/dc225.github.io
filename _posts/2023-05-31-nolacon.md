In May 2023, **DEF CON 225 (DC225)** made a natural decision. Instead of their regular May meetup, the group headed to NolaCon, the annual information security and hacking conference in New Orleans.

NolaCon is the place where the worlds of DC225 and cybersecurity unite. It's the natural destination for those passionate about information security, hacking, and all things tech.

NolaCon 2023 didn't just excel in information securityâ€”it also delivered on entertainment. The event featured electrifying performances by none other than int80 of [Dual Core](https://dualcoremusic.com/) and [Mikal KHill](https://mikalkhill.bandcamp.com/). Attendees were treated to a fusion of tech and music, creating an unforgettable experience that perfectly complemented the conference's cybersecurity focus. It was a captivating blend of talents that left everyone in awe.
